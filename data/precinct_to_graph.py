'''
In order to run a Markov chain, we need an adjacency Graph of our 
VTD geometries and Partition of our adjacency graph into districts.
 This Partition will be the initial state of our Markov chain.

Running the chain
Now weâ€™ll run the chain, putting the sorted Democratic vote percentages 
directly into a pandas DataFrame for analysis and plotting. 
The DataFrame will have a row for each state of the chain. 
The first column of the DataFrame will hold the lowest Democratic vote share 
among the districts in each partition in the chain, the second column will 
hold the second-lowest Democratic vote shares, and so on.
